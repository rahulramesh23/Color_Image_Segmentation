# A Simple UNET for the beginners using Keras-Tensorflow

I have collected 10 RGB images of patients with wounds along with the labels for the wound, skin and background regions. The goal is to show how one can rapidly prototype using UNET for segmenting the regions even with just a handful of data. 

Usage: clone the repository to your local machine and simply run the jupyter notebook
